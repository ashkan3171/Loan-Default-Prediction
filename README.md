# ðŸš€ Loan Default Prediction
A machine learning project to predict loan defaults, helping financial institutions assess risk effectively.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Loan default prediction is critical in the financial sector. This project applies **classification models** to predict whether a customer will **default on a loan** based on their financial history.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights:
âœ… **Data Preprocessing:** Encoding, feature selection, and scaling  
âœ… **Handling Class Imbalance:** Used **SMOTE** for a balanced dataset  
âœ… **Model Selection:** Compared **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost**  
âœ… **Best Model:** **XGBoost with 90.94% accuracy and 89% recall**

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **Total Rows:** 255,347
- **Numerical Features:** Age, Income, Loan Amount, Credit Score, etc.
- **Categorical Features:** Employment Type, Loan Purpose, Has Mortgage, etc.
- **Target Variable:** **Default (0 = No, 1 = Yes)**

## ðŸ“‰ Data Preprocessing
âœ” **Checked for missing values** (No missing data found)  
âœ” **Encoded categorical variables** using **One-Hot Encoding**  
âœ” **Scaled numerical features** using **MinMaxScaler**  
âœ” **Balanced dataset** with **SMOTE** (88% vs. 11% â†’ 50% vs. 50%)

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Comparison
| Model | Accuracy | Recall (Default 1) | F1-Score |
|--------|----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Logistic Regression** | 87.3% | 86% | 87% |
| **Random Forest** | 90.8% | 86% | 90% |
| **Optimized Random Forest** | 90.9% | 86% | 90% |
| **XGBoost (Best Model)** | **90.94%** | **89%** | **91%** |

ðŸ“Œ **Final Model: XGBoost** â†’ Achieved **highest recall (89%)**, meaning fewer loan defaulters were missed.
